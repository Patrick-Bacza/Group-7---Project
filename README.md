# Group-7---Project


#Proposal

The field we are interested in working with is mental health in the tech/non tech field. Mental health is something that effects everyone's lives and it would be impactful to find insights to helps us better understand it. The data we would be working with is a survey about attitudes towards mental health in tech companies provided by Kaggle.com.

We will clean the data and will perform all the analysis including statistical analysis for data sets.

These are some of the questions we can explore:

1) Are remote workers less effected by mental health in the workplace? 
2) Do males or females tend to be more effected by mental health? 
3) Does age tend to be more effected by mental health?
4) Do workers think their employers  are doing enough to address their employees mental health?
5) Analysis for mental and physical health consequence 
6) Are people from certain locations (state/country) more likely to have a mental health disorder?
7) Are certain job positions more likely to have mental health problems?
8) Are employees at larger companies more likely to have a mental health disorder?
9) If you have a mental health condition, do you feel that it interferes with your work?

Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While this subject could be studied indefinitely, we decided the following questions to be the best topics for the project:

- Do certain age groups tend to be more affected by mental health? (Stephen)
- Are employers doing enough to address their employees' mental health disorders? (Patrick)
- Do work conditions such as company size, remote work, and job type reflect on the number of those with mental health disorders? (Jay)
- If you have a mental health condition, how much does it interfere with your work? (Hays)
