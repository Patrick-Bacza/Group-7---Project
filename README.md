# Group-7---Project


#Proposal

The field we are interested in working with is mental health data. Mental health is something that effects everyones lives and it would be impactful to find insights to helps us better understand it. The data we would be working with is a survey about attitudes towards mental health in tech companies. 

We will clean the data and will perform all the analysis including statistical analysis for data sets.

These are some of the questions we can explore:

1) Are remote workers less effected by mental health in the workplace? 
2) Do males or females tend to be more effected by mental health? 
3) Does age tend to be more effected by mental health?
4) Do workers think their employers  are doing enough to address their employees mental health?
5) Analysis for mental and physical health consequence 
6) Are people from certain locations (state/country) more likely to have a mental health disorder?
7) Are certain job positions more likely to have mental health problems?
8) Are employees at larger companies more likely to have a mental health disorder?
9) If you have a mental health condition, do you feel that it interferes with your work?

Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While this subject could be studied indefinitely, we decided the following questions to be the best topics for the project:

- Does age tend to be more effected by mental health? (Stephen)
- Are employers doing enough to address their employees' mental health disorders? (Patrick)
- Do work conditions such as company size and remote work reflect on the number of those with mental health disorders? (Jay)
- If you have a mental health condition, how much does it interfere with your work? (Hays)
