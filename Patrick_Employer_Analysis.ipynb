    "### Are employers doing enough to address their employee's mental health?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In analyzing mental health trends inside the tech industry, it is important to see whether or not employers are doing enough to address their employees mental health needs. This survey gives us insight into that by asking the following three questions:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Do you know the options for mental health care available under your employer-provided health coverage?\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Granted employees are responsible for knowing their own benefits that are provided by their healthcare. nonetheless, employers can make sure they are communicating those benefits or at the very least reminding their employees that they have mental health benefits and they should findo ut what they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Does your employer offer resources to learn more about mental health disorders and options for seeking help?\n",
    "\n",
    "        At this point, every company should be offering resources to help employers with learning and managing their mental health disorders. We expect to see respondents answer yes to this overwhelmingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Has your employer ever formally discussed mental health (for example, as part of a wellness campaign or other official communication)?\n",
    "\n",
    "        It is important for companies to have a good line of communcation with their employees. Moreover, it is important for them to keep a consistent dialogue open about mental heath. we would hope that mostr respondents answer yes to this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    The thought process here is that the more yes responses we have the more we can say that tech companies are doing enough to take care of their employees' mental health and the more no's and I don't knows There are The more these companies need to improve. To analyze this, we'll first look at how many respondents answered yes to these three questions. Second, we'll look at each question individually.\n",

As you can see, most people either answered yes to one question  out of three (27.5%) or none of the questions (45%). Since that consists of almost three quarters of respondents, we can conclude that employers are not doing enough to address their employee's mental health needs. \n",

    "This graph shows that there are more respondents that do not know their options from their healthcare plan than not. Companies can be doing more to tell their employees what benefits they have or atleast remind them to atleast look at what mental healthcare optiosn are available  to them. Granted employees should know or atleast want to look into all of the benefits that they have under their healthcare plan. Something that could be affecting these responses is whether someone has or think they have a mental issue. They would be more inclined to find out what mental benefits they have under their health plan where as people who do not have mental issues may not be looking. It could be interesting to explore this more separating the respondents by whether they have a mental diagnosis or not."

    "Again, the same trend shows that more people answered no than yes although it is much closer (only a gap of 200 to 300). This graph does show two causes for concern. First, there are tech companies that are not offering resources to learn about mental health or options for seeking help. Second, a lot of respondents answered 'I don't know'. If companies are providing these resources then it is possible they are not doing a good enough job communicating with their employees about them. It could be smart to break this out by comnpany size. Larger companies may have more resources available to their employees where as small and medium sized companies may not provide as many resources to their employees"

    "This graph shows that employers are overwhelmingly failing at communicating with their employees about mental health. Combining this insight with the insights above makes it clear employers are not doing enough to assist their employees with their mental health needs. It seems like they are several companies that do not have resources or programs to help their employees to begin with. The biggest issue seems to be though that there is a lack of communication on the topic. Companies need to either open up or vastly improve dialogue on the subject."

    "The key insights we can take away from this is that employers are not doing enough to address their employee's needs. It was definitely surprising to see that a lot of companies are not offering resources to learn about  mental issues and options to deal with it. I would think that that would be a mainstay in most companies in the year 2022. I think it is quite evident that there is a break down in communication between employer and employee when it comes to mental health and that is something that employers can work to improve upon.\n",

    "I think we can further explore this question by looking at the question based on company size. I think people at a smaller company could have a different experience than someone working at a large company. Also, we could separate the data bewtween people who have a medical diagnosis and those who don't. People who do have anedical diagnosis would most likely be looking into any resources their company has or any benefits that are provided by their health plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this dataset is one sample. We could give the same survey to a different 4,000 people and get different results so we can say that this by no means comprehensive of the entire issue. "
